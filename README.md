# DGINN: Detection of Genetic INNovations pipeline

DGINN is a pipeline dedicated to the detection of genetic innovations, starting from a nucleotidic sequence.

It automatizes all the necessary preliminary steps for evolutionary
analyses, including retrieval of homologs, assignment to orthology
groups, codon alignment and reconstruction of gene phylogeny.

Once the alignements and corresponding phylogenies are obtained, three
major genetic innovations are detected: duplication events,
recombination events, and signatures of positive selection.

DGINN was validated on nineteen primate genes with known evolutionary histories, and results can be consulted in the associated paper
(doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa680).
Results from the validation are available in the [corresponding repository](https://github.com/leapicard/DGINN_validation).
The version of DGINN used in the paper refers to [commit 5db0253](https://github.com/leapicard/DGINN/commit/5db02532408afcafad50a0b70dcf247ab4800492)
and can be fetched through:

```{sh}
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/leapicard/DGINN
git fetch --depth 1 origin 5db02532408afcafad50a0b70dcf247ab4800492
git checkout FETCH_HEAD
```

The docker is available for both the paper version and the current version of DGINN.

![Diagram of DGINN main steps](https://github.com/leapicard/DGINN/blob/master/etc/pipeline_diagram.pdf)

# Installation

The pipeline is organized using snakemake.

## 1/ Necessary dependencies and softwares

-   Softwares and versions: [EMBOSS:6.6](http://en.bio-soft.net/format/emboss.html), [PRANK v.170427](http://wasabiapp.org/software/prank/prank_installation/), [MACSE V2.07](https://bio.tools/macse), [PhyML 3.0](https://github.com/stephaneguindon/phyml), [IQTREE v 2.6.6](http://www.iqtree.org), [Treerecs v1.0](https://gitlab.inria.fr/Phylophile/Treerecs), [HYPHY 2.3](http://www.hyphy.org/installation/), [Bio++ v.3](https://github.com/BioPP)
-   Python (>3.5) and packages: Biopython, ete3, collections, logging, shlex, os, numpy, scipy, requests, pandas, statistics, time, re, argparse
-   Snakemake

## 2/ Conda and containers

The simplest way to use DGINN is through the use of a conda environment or a container, which
frees the user from the necessity of installing all of DGINN's
dependencies, and should make cross-platform usage possible (Linux/Mac
OS/Windows).

### 2.1/ Conda

We provide a conda setting for DGINN, through file environment.yml. To
run locally, first create and activate a conda environment from
environment.yml:

```shell
conda env create --file=environment.yml
conda activate dginn
```

then, in the working directory

```shell
snakemake -s path_to_Snakefile --cores 1 --configfile=configuration_file
```

In case you want to allow more than one core for the analysis, set up
the "--cores" option accordingly. If the number is omitted (i.e., only
--cores is given), the number of used cores is determined as the
number of available CPU cores in the machine.

### 2.2/ Containers

The user can use either of the images that we provide through
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) or
[Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/latest/quick_start.html),
so the only software installation needed is the one for the chosen
container system.

Please be aware that, due to Docker necessitating root access, the
Docker container is not appropriate for usage in cluster environments,
though it is appropriate for cloud computing (tutorial to come) and
local usage. The Singularity container should be usable in every
environment.

#### a/ Docker

To use docker you will have to clone this repository first, and then build the docker image with:

```{sh}
docker build . -t dginn
```

After that, you will be able to run DGINN with:

```{sh}
docker run --rm -u $(id -u $USER) -v $(pwd):/local dginn --cores 1 --configfile config_example.yaml
```

The command should be run as is, and should work on both Mac and Linux systems, provided the user belong to the 'docker' group (please refer to the [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/) for help about setting the user as part of this group on Linux.)

We unfortunately cannot promise about the Docker container's usability on Windows. In case the container doesn't work, we advise the user to try the Apptainer container.

#### b/ Apptainer / Singularity

To use an Apptainer or Singularity container you will have to clone this repository. You can then build the image by running the following at its root:

```{sh}
apptainer build dginn.sif Apptainer
```

To use the container, you can run the following from the root of the repository:

```{sh}
apptainer run dginn.sif --cores 1 --configfile config_example.yaml
```

If you want to run DGINN from another folder, you can specify the path to the Snakefile file in the cloned repository:

```{sh}
apptainer run /path/to/dginn.sif -s /path/to/Snakefile --cores 1 --configfile config_example.yaml
```

# Usage

## 1/ Configuration file

DGINN uses a parameter file to pass all the necessary arguments for launching the pipeline.
Two example files are provided in the examples directory:

1. one performing steps 1-7 (see Overview) from the CDS of the gene of interest to the detection of recombination (parameters.txt)
2. one performing step 8 for the detection of positive selection (parameters_possel.txt)

This is the recommended usage for DGINN, so that analyses for positive selection can be parallelized over all alignments instead of doing them sequentially.

Please be aware that fasta sequence name **and** queryName must follow
the format speSpe_GENE_Id for matching (ex: homSap_MX1_CCDS13673,
macMul_APOBEC3G_NM_001198693).

| Step              | Necessary file\(s\)                        | Format                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| blast             | CDS of the gene of interest                | Fasta                       |
| accessions        | List of blast results                      | NCBI tabulated format (tsv) |
| fasta             | List of accession identifiers \(one/line\) | Txt                         |
| orf               | mRNA sequences of orthologs                | Fasta                       |
| alignment         | CDS sequences of orthologs                 | Fasta                       |
| tree              | \(codon\) alignment of orthologs           | Fasta                       |
| duplication       | \(codon\) alignment, gene tree             | Fasta, newick               |
| recombination     | \(codon\) alignment                        | Fasta                       |
| positiveSelection | codon alignment, gene tree                 | Fasta, gene tree            |

File order must be respected and follow the one indicated in this table.

Though codon alignments are not technically necessary for the phyml, duplication and recombination steps, they are for positiveSelection.
Thus, starting at steps upstream of positiveSelection with non codon alignments will probably lead to failure at the positiveSelection step.

## 3/ Positive selection

DGINN includes different softwares to check for positive selection:

-   BUSTED (Murrel et al., Molecular Biology and Evolution, 2015) from Hyphy
-   MEME (Murrel et al., PLoS Genetics, 2012) from Hyphy
-   PAML codeml (Yang, Molecular Biology and Evolution, 2007) for site models M0, M1, M2, M7, M8a and M8
-   BIO++ (Guéguen et al., Molecular Biology and Evolution, 2013) for site models M0, M1, M2, M7 M8a, M8, M10 and DFP_07
-   BIO++ for one-per-branch (OPB) model (similar to PAML codeml FreeRatio model) to test positive selection on branches

The first three methods are automatically parameterized in DGINN.

For BIO++, the parameter files can be automatically generated by DGINN, but the user can also provide their own parameter files if they wish to tweak the parameters further. The OPB option can also be used for different analyses using Bio++ as its results do not influence any subsequent step. Example parameter files for bppml and bppmixedlikelihoods (for site models) are provided in examples/, as well as a parameter file for running a one-per-branch model.

Users wishing to do the fastest check possible on their genes of interest are encouraged to run only BIO++ site models,
as our validation results point to their providing the best compromise of solid results and shorter running times.

# Tutorial

## 1/ Example files

In the examples folder, two parameter files are provided.

NB: these files should be updated with the paths to the files referred to instead of just their name when using DGINN through the command line and not through the docker.

```
snakemake --cores python3 DGINN.py -p parameters.txt
```

Will launch DGINN steps 1-7 on ex_CCDS.fasta by :

-   retrieving homologs of primate species in the NCBI _nr_ database
-   detecting duplications and assigning ortholog groups of at least 8 species based on ex_spTree.tree
-   detecting recombination events

```
python3 DGINN.py -p parameters_possel.txt
```

Will launch DGINN step 8 on ex_aln.fasta and ex_genetree.tree by :

-   looking for positive selection on the gene using BUSTED
-   looking for sites under episodic positive selection using MEME
-   looking for sites under positive selection using models M0-NS, M1-NS, M2-NS, M7-NS, M8a-NS and M8-NS from BIO++
-   looking for sites under positive selection using models M0, M1, M2, M7, M8a and M8 from PAML codeml
-   looking for branches under positive selection using BIO++

## 2/ Validation data

DGINN was validated on nineteen primate genes with known evolutionary histories, and results can be consulted on BioRxiv
(doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.964155).
Results from the validation are available in the [corresponding repository](https://github.com/leapicard/DGINN_validation).

# Utility scripts

Several utility scripts upstream and downstream of DGINN in the etc folder,

## 1/ Upstream

### 1/ multi_dginn

multi_dginn.py allows the user to run several DGINN containers in
parallel, from a file of several inputs. A maximum number of running
containers can be entered (default is 4) and processes are run up to
this maximum. Later (when some runs are completed) the same script can
be run on the same file of inputs, and successive analyses will be
run. So, by calling repetively this script, the user will easily
complete as many analyses as wanted.

```
python3 DGINN/etc/multi_dginn.py dataname -p parameters [-i image][-v][-j jobs]

where:

   dataname: name of the file where the input names are stored per
             line (aka used as argument of --infile option of
             DGINN.py).

   -p parameters: name of the DGINN parameters file (aka used with
                  option -p in DGINN.py).

optional arguments:
   -h show this help message and exit

   -i image: name of the docker image used (default lpicard/dginn).

   -j jobs : number of jobs used in parallel (default 4)

   -v  verbosity of the commands.   (default False)
```

### 2/ CCDSquery

CCDSquery.py allows the user to download the CCDS sequences of human
genes, by providing the properly formatted file obtained through HGNC.
This file should at least contain a column titled "Approved symbol"
and another titled "CCDS accession".

```
python3 DGINN/etc/CCDSQuery.py -h
usage: DGINN/etc/CCDSQuery.py [-h] -in <filename>

This program get sequences' genes from HGNC Biomart.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Mandatory input infos for running:
  -in <filename>, --inFile <filename>
                        Table of HGNC approved symbols (one per line) and
                        corresponding CCDS accessions for the genes of
                        interest, obtained from HGNC Biomart
```

## 2/ Downstream

### 1/ recup_to_parse

recup_to_parse produces a file that will be used by parseResult (see
below) to parse the output of DGINN analyses.

recup_to_parse is to be run in the directory from which all DGINN
analyses have been run, and where the output files
"tag_DGINN_date.log" are written. The script scans all those file,
keeping the most recent successful one for each tag, in case there
have been several analyses.

Message outputs whether analyses seem to have worked well (+tag) or
positive selection but no clean exit (~tag), or not at all (-tag).
Any gene with + or ~ sign is written in the parsing file.

```
python3 recup_to_parse.py [-o outfile]

where:

-o outfile: output file that will parsed by parseResults.py

```

### 2/ parseResult

parseResult parses a file describing where results of DGINN are to be
found for several genes, and output a summary of the analyses in a
single file.

The input file is composed of two tab-separated columns: the first one
indicates the full path to the directories containing the positive
selection results (the directory containing the subdirectories busted,
bpp_site, paml_site, etc.), the second one the full path to the
alignments on which those analyses were performed.

Ex: /PATH/TO/GENENAME_sequences_filtered_longestORFs_mafft_mincov_prank_results_TIMESTAMP1/positive_selection_results_TIMESTAMP2 /PATH/TO/GENENAME_sequences_filtered_longestORFs_mafft_mincov_prank.best.fas

The script will output 2 different files:

1. a summary of results (one gene per line)
2. the percentages of coverage at each position of each alignment (NB: it is advised not to modify this file in any capacity to ensure proper visualization of the results)
 <!--- 3. the likelihoods calculated by Bio++ (Bpp) and PAML codeml for each gene. --->

The different output files obtained with this script can be used to generate figures similar to those exposed in the DGINN paper through the [Shiny app](https://leapicard.shinyapps.io/DGINN-visualization/), which documentation can be found on the [corresponding repository](https://github.com/leapicard/DGINN-visualization).

```
python3 DGINN/etc/parseResults.py -h
usage: DGINN/etc/parseResults.py [-h] [-v] -in <filename> [-o <path/to/directory>] [-pr <value>] [-pm <value>]

This program outputs a summary of the results obtained through running DGINN on a list of genes of interest.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         display DGINN/etc/parseResults.py version number and exit

Mandatory input infos for running:
  -in <filename>, --inFile <filename>
                        List of all the directories containing the results from DGINN analyses on different genes, and their corresponding alignments.

Optional input infos (default values):
  -o <path/to/directory>, --outdir <path/to/directory>
                        folder for analysis results (path - by default output file will be saved in the incoming directory)
  -pr <value>, --postrate <value>
                        Threshold posterior probability of omega>1 to admit positive selected sites.
  -pm <value>, --pvmeme <value>
                        Maximum p-value of PS site significance for MEME method.cd
```
